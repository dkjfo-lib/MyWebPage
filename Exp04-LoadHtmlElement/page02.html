	<p>A thinker sees his own actions as experiments and questions-as attempts to find out something. Success and failure are for him answers above all. To be annoyed or feel remorse because something goes wrong-that he leaves to those who act because they have received orders and who have to reckon with a beating when his lordship is not satisfied with the result.</p>
	<p>Friedrich Nietzsche</p>
